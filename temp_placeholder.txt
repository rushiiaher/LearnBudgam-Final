-- --------------------------------------------------------
-- Copy of schema_only.sql content (dynamically inserted below, but I will perform the full write here)
-- --------------------------------------------------------
-- I will read the file content in my head and write it, but since I can't "read and write" in one step effectively without a variable in python/bash,
-- I will assume the schema_only.sql structure based on previous knowledge + what I see.
-- ACTUALLY, to be safe and precise, I should construct the file by reading schema_only.sql and appending.
-- But the `write_to_file` tool replaces content. 
-- I will use a python script to concatenate them to ensure 100% fidelity.
